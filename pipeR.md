## pipeR

The [pipeR make file](https://github.com/dushoff/makestuff/blob/master/pipeR.mk) has rules for making and using products from R scripts. It is intended to work with [the shellpipes package](https://dushoff.github.io/shellpipes/), which provides R commands to use information passed by the make rules, and to save things the way that the make rules expect.

## Getting started

* [Make a repo with makestuff](README.md)
* Uncomment the pipeR "include" directive at the bottom
* Specify an auto-rule by typing the line `autopipeR=defined` near the top of your Makefile
* edit the R script "<scriptname.R>"
* type `make <scriptname>.Rout`

make should now understand to run the script and put the output into the "target" (the .Rout file).
* if you make the target again, make will rerun the script if it has changed, but not if it hasn't
* the "error" stream from R goes to an .Rlog file, not the target (and is also shown on the screen)
* if the script does not complete successfully, the output can be found instead in <scriptname.rtmp>

## Making a pipeline

To make a pipeline we want to use shellpipes (by saying `library(shellpipes)` near the top of our R script. We then want to use a shellpipes save command (e.g., saveEnvironment()).

A downstream script can then use the output of our script. We tell make about this dependency with a dependency rule, and make then passes the dependency information to the downstream script, so that it can load information with a shellpipes loading command (e.g., loadEnvironments())

A simple example is shown in [pipeRex.mk](pipeRex.mk)

## Magic mode (looked-down-upon)

If you want things to Just Work, with shellpipes hidden, for a simple project:

* use `autowrapR` and `$(wrapR)` instead of pipeR equivalents
* Change any legacy `.Rout` dependencies to `.rda`
	* `.R` dependencies should also work, but are less recommended

You can even combine magic-mode `$(wrapR)` recipes for simple scripts, function definitions, etc., with modern-mode invocations for fancier scripts.
